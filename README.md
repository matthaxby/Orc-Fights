# Orc-Fights
A simple fight game between orcs. So far they are not orcs at all, but merely fruit and sea-mammals. 

This is mostly a learning project that I'm adding to as the Galvanize Full Stack course progresses.  It takes two contestants, supposedly orcs although that is not the case so far, and recursively fights them based on their health and strength attributes.  Eventually it will have a flip-book style animation for each fight.  And I think it already looks pretty cool.  

Anyone is welcome to contribute!
